##Project

We will coordinate via DM on Slack & Github to design a web app that analyses BCH and BTC blockchains and showcases them in a similar style as the highway meme originally created by Maplesyrupsucker. Data will be analyzed in a similar fashion as Cash Drop. Variations in sprites based on TX size will be used to produce a more balanced interactive meme with variations. Additional data will be displayed, such as transactions waiting to clear, as well as transaction size upon click of a vehicle (transaction). The asset will be a Github hosted web app that allows for users both new and old to easily visualize the problem with the BTC network and highlight the value of Bitcoin Cash.  

The expected outcome of the project is to bring more users to Bitcoin Cash and get them using Bitcoin Cash. We also want to help increase donations to the Bitcoin Cash Fund by providing a unique interactive feature that gamify's the donation process.

##Summary

TX Highway aims to showcase in a fun, clear and dynamic way the key benefits of Bitcoin Cash over Bitcoin Core by creating an interactive meme that monitors transactions on BCH and BTC. Building off the success of the recently launched Cash Drop app (https://porlybe.github.io/cashdrop/), developed by Porlybe and inspired by the popular Bit Bonkers (bitbonkers.com). We want to better showcase the improvements in BCH by creating an interactive meme, inspired by the design of Maplesyrupsucker's popular illustration comparing the BCH blockchain to an 8 lane highway and BTC to a single lane highway with a toll road.

Each vehicle will represent a transaction. Sprites will vary based on transaction amount. 

We will also set up monitoring of the **Bitcoin Cash Fund address** and allow users to donate to that address. A donation sent to that specified address will trigger a Lambo to go across the screen, allowing users to easily see their own donation as well as others donations to the fund. With a steady stream of donations users may be more likely to donate based on the desire to "Go Lambo".

###Other

We're currently looking at our options for hosting. We believe a hosted Github page will likely work with a custom domain. Although we may require some hosting to properly pull data from blockchair. We have reached out to a member of the Bitcoin Cash slack with more experience in hosting secure sites to see if they'd be interested in teaming up.
