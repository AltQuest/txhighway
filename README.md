# txhighwayBTCC.info

Credit goes to the creators of the original txhighway.com website, which has earned its place as a humorous illustration of transaction volume between Bitcoin, and the altcoin fork created on August 1st 2017, commonly referred to as Bcash. While the original txhighway developers strongly disagree with the path that consensus has chosen for Bitcoin, the site itself shows a good deal of creativity, and it's been enjoyable to tinker around with their creation. Unfortunately development has stagnated, causing the site to become slow, expensive and unreliable. The goal of this repo is to bring back the fun, creative spirit of the site's original vision, and also make it cheaper, faster, and more reliable. 

Contributions are welcome, although this isn't a project I would like to spend a lot of time supporting. If you're inclined to donate funds to this project, please donate to the orignal developers of txhighway.com instead.
