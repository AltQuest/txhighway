Timeline
===


#### Phase 1 - Design / Development / Web app (included in budget)

- November 26th, 2017 - December 1st, 2017 - Design 
- November 26th, 2017 - December 10th, 2017 - Frontend integration
- November 26th, 2017 - December December 26th - Development
- November 26th, 2017 - January 5th, 2018 - Project Management

#### Phase 2 - Education Materials and creation (not included in budget)

We have been in contact with another interested member of the Bitcoin Cash community with over seven years experience working in the education sector. This simple to use visualizer could be the perfect complimentary tool for in class presentations for explaining to children the benefits of Bitcoin Cash, and the problems facing the legacy chain. In addition, children will be exposed to the idea of cryptocurrency 

This phase will include:

- Create quizzes based on grade level
- Create sample assignments for teachers to send home with kids
- Create education packs for kids to take home to their parents
- Revise web app with integrated online quizes tied
- Revise web app to include a teachers portal   to provide additional documents 

#### Phase 3 - In class presentations to students (not included in budget)

**Sheri Serife Ucar** - A proud Bitcoin Cash enthusiast who has conducted research into social and emotional learning. She brings over seven years of in class presentation to young children from kindergarden up to 12 year old adolescents. Sheri also has experience pitching materials into educational curriculums. 

**Pitch material to school boards** - By providing all appropriate paperwork as well as setting up meetings with the appropriate people on school boards, Sheri will aim to include as many schools as possible, beginning in Australia. Her model can be replicated throughout many parts of the world. With enough interest from school boards based on printed materials as well as in-person meetings, we feel we have a good shot of bringing Bitcoin Cash into children's lives. 

**In Class Bitcoin Cash Presentations**

With accompanying printed materials, Sheri, along with other recruited trusted members will present to local school officials and provide in class presentations with students in front of a computer lab. Students will learn about Bitcoin Cash with the assistance of our highway blockchain visualizer, and learning about the blockchain, how merchants and consumers can use Bitcoin Cash. Students will also be exposed to the fundamentals on using Bitcoin Cash in daily life. The TX Highway themed materials makes for a simple way for students, teachers, and parents to learn about the blockchain, the differences between Bitcoin Cash and the legacy chain, and what the future may have in store for the future of Bitcoin.


Presentations will include: 

- Games
- Passing bitcoin cash around on sample phones with empty wallets
- Demo donations to Bitcoin Cash Fund to show the speed of a transaction
- Demo address monitoring
- Quiz material

Project
===

We will coordinate via chat.thebitcoincash.fund & Github to design a web app that analyzes BCH and BTC blockchains and showcases them in a similar style as the highway illustration originally created by Maplesyrupsucker. Data will be analyzed in a similar fashion as Cash Drop. Variations in sprites based on TX size will be used to produce a more balanced interactive block analysis tool with variations. Additional data will be displayed, such as transactions waiting to clear, as well as transaction size with the aid of a pull out menu. The asset will be a Github hosted web app that allows for users both new and old to easily visualize the problem with the BTC network and highlight the value of Bitcoin Cash.  

The expected outcome of the project is to bring more users to Bitcoin Cash and get them using Bitcoin Cash. We also want to help increase donations to the Bitcoin Cash Fund by providing a unique interactive feature that gamify's the donation process.

Summary
===

TX Highway aims to showcase in a fun, clear and dynamic way the key benefits of Bitcoin Cash over Bitcoin Core by creating an interactive blockchain visualizer that monitors transactions on BCH and BTC. Building off the success of the recently launched Cash Drop app (https://porlybe.github.io/cashdrop/), developed by Porlybe and inspired by the popular Bit Bonkers (bitbonkers.com). We want to better showcase the improvements in BCH by creating an interactive blockchain visualizer, inspired by the design of Maplesyrupsucker's popular illustration comparing the BCH blockchain to an 8 lane highway and BTC to a single lane highway with a toll road. 

![sample](https://puu.sh/ytDPL/5e6d00e149.png "Sample")

Each vehicle will represent a transaction. Sprites will vary based on transaction amount. 

We will also set up monitoring of the **Bitcoin Cash Fund address** and allow users to donate to that address. A donation sent to that specified address will trigger a Lambo to go across the screen, allowing users to easily see their own donation as well as others donations to the fund. With a steady stream of donations users may be more likely to donate based on the desire to unlock a unique sprite. 

We will also setup address monitoring so users can easily watch as their BCH and BTC wallet receives transactions.

We're currently looking at our options for hosting. We believe a hosted Github page will likely work with a custom domain. Although we may require some hosting to properly pull data from blockchair. We have reached out to a member of the Bitcoin Cash slack with more experience in hosting secure sites to see if they'd be interested in teaming up. Judging by our demo's we're fairly sure free Github Pages will suffice.
